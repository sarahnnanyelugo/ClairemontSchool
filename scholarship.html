    We currently offer the  Clairemont School Foundation Scholarship to Students entering grade 1-6 only.<br>

    Clairemont School Foundation Scholarships is exclusive to students who show enthusiasm and motivation for academic excellence and whose families demonstrate financial need. The Foundation has established these scholarships for students entering grades 1–6 to provide an opportunity for students to reap the benefits of attending a private independent school, students who may not otherwise have the opportunity to do so.
    The amount of the scholarship will vary according to the family’s financial need as determined by the financial award process. These scholarships are renewable through graduation and do not need to be repaid.
