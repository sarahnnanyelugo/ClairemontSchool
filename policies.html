<h3>Child Safeguarding Policy
</h3>



<h4>1.0:Clairemont Nursery and Primary School Policy<br>
</h4>

<p>Clairemont School believes that all forms of abuse and exploitation suffered by children are unacceptable. Clairemont aims to ensure that all children who come in contact with our school is safe from all forms of abuse and exploitation. Clairemont School is committed to protecting children and seeks to ensure that children we work with are not harmed or abused as a result of our actions. The possibility of staff, consultants or parents abusing children is one which the school takes seriously and is committed to working to prevent.
The child safeguarding policy is vital to the organization and it is expected that all staff and representatives understand why it is important and how to implement it. Child protection is a corporate and an individual responsibility. This policy extends beyond professional role in the workplace to conduct on one’s personal life.


Clairemont School has zero tolerance to child abuse and staff. All staff will be made familiar with the need for a child protection concern in all that we do. Associations with anyone found to be engaging in abusive and exploitative relationships with children will be broken.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of this policy, a “child” is defined as anyone under the age of 18, in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the Child Right Act of the Federal Government of Nigeria.
  </p><h5>1.2 Child abuse</h5>
  <p>Child abuse consists of anything which individuals, institutions or processes do or fail to do which directly or indirectly harms children or damages their prospect of a safe and healthy development into adulthood
    Commission of Inquiry into the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (UK) 1996 , later the Children ‘s Act 2004<br><br>
    </p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <h3>PROTECTION POLICY, PROCEDURES AND GUIDANCE</h3>
  <h5>The definition point to five types of abuse:
  </h5><br><br>
  
  <h4>Physical abuse</h4>:<p>This is actual physical harm and may involve hitting, shaking, throwing, poisoning, burning or scalding, drowning, suffocating, or otherwise causing physical harm to a child including fabricating the symptoms of, or deliberately causing, ill health to a child.</p>
  <h5>Neglect:</h5> <p>The persistent failure to meet a child’s basic physical and/or psychological needs, likely to result in the serious impairment of the child’s health or development, such as failing to provide adequate food, shelter and clothing, or neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child’s basic emotional needs.</p>
  <h5>Emotional abuse: </h5><p>Persistent or emotional ill treatment of a child that adversely affects their development. May involve conveying to a child that they are worthless, unloved, and inadequate, there only to meet the needs of another; or where inappropriate expectations are imposed upon them. In addition it includes children who are regularly frightened, exploited or corrupted.</p>
  <h5>Sexual abuse:</h5> <p>is the involvement of a child in sexual activity. It may involve forcing or enticing a child to take part in sexual activities, whether or not the child is aware of what is happening. The activities may involve physical contact, including penetrative or non-penetrative acts. This may also include involving children in looking at, or in the production of, pornographic material, or encouraging children to behave in sexually inappropriate ways.
   trafficking, sex trade, child labour, drugs smuggling, child soldiers, exchanging sex for other favours</p>
  <h4>2. Recruitment & Training
  </h4>
  <p>2.1 Head of School, staff, interns and contractors will be carefully and properly screened during their recruitment period. This will include:
  - asking the candidate to sign a declaration of criminal convictions as part of the application process
  - obtaining a police check where possible.
  - obtaining a reliable character and professional reference, with particular attention given to any area of concern relating to child protection
  - During the interview, questions bordering on child protection and the candidates attitudes, perceptions and knowledge about keeping children safe would be asked<br><br>
  2.2 All prospective employees, interns, contractors, parents and board members will undertake induction and training on the school’s Child Safeguarding policy which is relevant and appropriate to their position. Staff will sign the Child safeguarding Policy at the time they are given their induction or at the same time they sign their contract, agreeing to uphold its principles and values, and to comply with its rules.<br><br>
  2.3 Individuals who are hired as independent contractors will be briefed and given a copy of the organization’s Child Safeguarding Policy and required to sign a declaration that they have received and understood it.<br><br>
  2.6 Volunteers with the school will be monitored by the Team Leaders to whom they are assigned to ensure that confidential information concerning children is not misused. Where there are concerns, managers should inform the (Head Human Resource Dept), who will investigate further.</p>
  <h4>3.0 Behaviour Protocols
  </h4><p>Behaviour protocols are rules of appropriate and proper behaviour, which are designed to protect children but are also intended to protect adults from false accusations of inappropriate behaviour or abuse. These protocols apply to employees, volunteers, board members, contractors, sponsors and any visitors to the school community..
  3.1 Clairemont personnel and visitors must not spend unnecessary time alone with children, including in the following situations: in a car, overnight in your home, or the home of a child, in office, in a camp, at activity sites etc. or sleep with pupils in the same house without prior approval by the line manager. Such approval can only be given if there is concern that not doing so might put the children at risk of abuse or exploitation and if there are no other suitable options<br><br>
  3.2 Clairemont personnel and visitors should not hire children as “house help” or promote any form of exploitative child labor
  .3.3 Clairemont personnel and visitors must not fondle or kiss children. They must also not hold, hug or touch children in an inappropriate or culturally insensitive way. To avoid misunderstanding, it is recommended that a child be asked for permission before touching him/her in a culturally appropriate way, for example holding hands.
  3.4 Where possible and practical, the “two-adult” rule, wherein two or more adults supervise all activities where children are involved and are present at all times, should be followed. If this is not possible, Clairemont staff members are encouraged to look for alternatives such as being accompanied by another staff on visits to children. In addition, gender should be considered in the “two-adult” rule, for example a girl should never be in a situation where she is alone with 2 male staff.<br><br>
  Clairemont staff or representatives must never hit or otherwise physically assault or physically abuse children<br>
  Clairemont staff or representatives must not develop physical/sexual relationships with children or develop any form of relationship with children which could in any way be deemed exploitative or abusive<br>
  Clairemont staff or representatives must not be aware of these and not do anything about it.<br>
  Clairemont staff or representatives must not exploit their own position vis-à-vis the pupil by making them run errands, do domestic work or carry out other forms of economic exploitation<br>
  Clairemont staff or representatives must not act in ways intended to shame, humiliate or degrade children, or otherwise perpetuate any form of emotional abuse<br>
  Clairemont personnel need to be aware that they may work with children who, because of the circumstances and abuses they have experienced, may use a relationship to obtain “special attention”. The adult is always considered responsible even if a child behaves seductively. Adults should avoid being placed in a compromising or vulnerable position.<br>
  Clairemont is committed to creating a child friendly environment and to ensure that how we work is safe and doesn’t put children at risk of harm<br>
  Inappropriate behaviour towards children is grounds for discipline.</p>
  <h5>4. Procedures for Reporting Suspected or Actual Abuse of Children
  </h5><p>4.1 Should a member of Clairemont receive any information about, or observe actual or suspected child abuse by a staff, contactor, visitor or any other representative he or she must immediately inform the designate Child Protection focal person.{ The Head of School} If the concern involves the Clairemont focal person, the concern must be reported to the school’s Executive Director of Human Resources. If the concern involves the Director of HR, the concern should be reported to the Executive Director CEO, President, (or any such top placed positions as available in the school)
  Note: The reporter is not required to investigate or try to find “more proof” before making the report. They must just make the report, and the process of investigation will be handled confidentially by trained senior staff member.<br><br>
  4.2 Reporting of child abuse is a requirement of the school and should be undertaken by staff, contractors and other representatives. Non-reporting is considered to be a breach of the Child Safeguarding Policy.<br>
  </p>
  
  <h4>RISK ASSESSMENT:
  </h4><p>All Clairemont staff, contractors and interns must conduct and document a risk assessment when planning a new activity or event that would involve the participation of children. Taking children out of their primary environment e.g. for excursions, state level activity etc. in particular is considered to be a high risk activity.
  A Risk Assessment Matrix is provided and should be completed well in advance of the activity or event. (Refer to Appendix I – Risk Assessment Matrix)
  Use this Matrix to identify any risk to the safety and well being of children, assess the level of risk, and develop strategies to reduce this risk.
  To do a risk assessment one must:
  Consider any risk factors in the program or activity taking into account:
  The age, race, social background, gender, skin color, disability, religion, beliefs, citizenship or sexual orientation of the children
  The setting or environment (e.g. is it outdoors, in a Shelter Home, one-on-one, at night, etc.)
  What is involved in the program or activity (e.g. workshops)
  The level of supervision and ratio of adults to children
  Any other risk factor you can identify
  Evaluate the level of risk of each of the identified factors as HIGH, MEDIUM or LOW.
  Prioritize the factors according to their level of risk.
  Develop strategies to minimize the risk in order to reduce the likelihood of harm or abuse occurring.
  If a child will be physically present at an activity the child as well as her or his parents/guardians must complete:
  a Parental / Child Consent form (annex 2 and 3);
  </p>
  <h5>5. Communications about Children
  </h5><p>5.1 Photographs or videos of children must be decent and respectful, and not presenting them as victims. Children should be adequately clothed and poses that could be interpreted as sexually suggestive must be avoided. Language that implies a relationship of power should also be avoided. However, we also recognize there are times when children are in reality victims, for example, of famine. In such cases the child’s dignity should still be preserved whilst presenting the reality.
  5.2 No Clairemont staff or partners is allowed to scan images of children onto Websites nor can any child’s photo or video be used for promotional materials without formal permission of the School.
  5.3 Child’s personal and physical information that could be used to identify the location of a child within a country should not be used on Clairemont web sites or in any other form of communication about the child.
  5.4 Individuals or organizations requesting the use of Claremont’s resources such as videos or photographs should be required to sign an agreement with the organization as
  to the proper use of such materials, in line with the Child Safeguarding Policy. The agreement will include a statement that any use of such materials for purposes other than what is agreed upon could subject the borrowing individual or organization to legal action. Furthermore, failure to adhere to the agreed upon use of the material will result in the immediate termination of the organization’s permission to
   use the subject materials and/or require immediate return of all materials provided by the agency as well as any copies of such materials.</p>
  <h5>6. Partner Organizations
  </h5>
  <p>6.1 Any agreement between Clairemont and partners which provide services to children will require assurance that child safeguarding
  policies and procedures are in place, acknowledging that lack of such policies can place children and the agency at risk.</p>
