    Catholics preparing to receive Baptism, first Holy Communion and Confirmation, attend catechism classes on Saturdays 3:30 p.m.
    and on Sundays, once a month. There, they are taught about the Christian faith and beliefs. They study the scriptures and are
     guided to have a personal relationship with God. They also get to know more about the Catholic Church and her doctrines.
     At the end of each second
     anniversary of the dedication of the School Chapel, the students receive the sacraments administered by the Bishop and the
     Parish Priest.

            </span><br><br>
            During Lenten and advent seasons, a day of recollection is always organized for staff and students. Recollection is the time we take stock of our lives and ask ourselves fundamental questions such as: What is my relationship with God like? Where am I coming from and where am I going? Relevant talks are given and scripture passages are given to students and staff to pray with on their own. It is usually a day of silence,
            a day of reflection. For the Catholics, arrangement is made for individual confession. Counselling is open to all.
